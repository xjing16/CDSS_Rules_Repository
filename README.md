# CDSS_Rules_Repository
This is a collection of CDSS rules based on the USA CDC's recommended immunization schedules in different formats.
The original CDC recommendations PDF was included in the Main branch. Then, different formats of the rules were organized into different branches, including Tabular, Charts, MS Excel, and CQL.
